<!-- Features / The ThruThink premise begins with EBITDA. -->
<p>With <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em>, earnings for a business  is expressed as Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes,
    Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). It presents the platform to either see the effects of an existing debt and equity structure or to design
    a preferred debt and equity structure to provide the appropriate capitalization to weather start up risks, acquisition risks, expected business
    performance and to protect against the unexpected  events that inevitably come along in the life of most businesses.</p>
<p>Because EBITDA is a result of Sales less Expenses, <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> does incorporate the ability to input
    Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Other operating expenses that will then calculate EBITDA or the User may jump directly to EBITDA, bypass the
    Sales and Expense Inputs and enter EBITDA directly as an input.</p>
