                    <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> is designed to illustrate the often times complex relationship between the business performance of Sales/Expenses and
                    Income Taxes, Cash Flow, Net Income and the Balance Sheet in an understandable and clear manner. This is a perfect classroom exercise to show the
                    way busness really functions and provides the opportunity to discuss the effect of Sales, Cost of Goods Sold, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Accounts
                    Payable, Income Taxes, Debt repayment and Equity Positions. Each student can formulate their own business model from a set of facts provided by a case
                    study. An increasingly advanced set of facts as the class goes along can provide countless opportunities for indepth discussion of business principles
                    and entail synergistic learning for the students.
