<!-- Features / Impromptu or Non Scheduled Adjustments -->
<p>As cash flow dictates, on the Cash Flow Summary Form, the User may make summary annual non scheduled or "extra" inputs for Sales,
    Expenses, or extra loan payments or loan draws on several of the major debt categories to supplement or manage cash availability
    which provides unlimited "what if" and sustainability analysis. All such inputs update the Balance Sheet, Income Statement and
    Sources & Uses of Cash Reports.</p>
