<!-- Exit Strategy / Sale or Purchase of a portion of the business -->
<p>With <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em>, an owner can look at the effect of selling
    a portion of the business to raise capital. Answers can be explored to such questions as "How much will
    sales and EBITDA have to increase with the added capital from an equity investment to make it worthwhile to
    the selling Owner".</p>
<p>Conversely, an Equity Group or partner can look at the effect of buying a portion of the business and leaving
    the Owner as an Equity partner. How will the business have to perform to make the investment worthwhile, how
    much equity is required to acomplish that performance and how much equity for that contribution do I need or
    should I negotiate from the owner?</p>
