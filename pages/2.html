<!-- Features / ThruThink Evaluation -->
<p>The <em>ThruThink Evaluation<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> is the process that evaluates the "Deal" or comparative
    benefit to the Owner as presented by the User Inputs and calculates the <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em>.
    The <em>ThruThink Evaluation<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> combines historical information, operational budgets or
    projections with specific debt, equity structure and Owner Draw requirements thereby addressing the ultimate performance measure of
    the "Deal", "Does it Make Sense".</p>
<p>As <tt>EBITDA</tt> comes as a result of the net effect of income and expenses prior to interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
    <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> incorporates the ability to determine EBITDA by using Gross Sales performance
    and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) percentages, along with summary General Operating Expenses. This is to illustrate sales and expense levels
    that are contemplated in arriving at the projected EBITDA.</p>
<p>The <em>ThruThink Evaluation<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> begins where an operational budget ends. The Users Operational
    Budget is best used as a basis for the <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> inputs, however the User can decide on
    these inputs as they are entered.</p>
<p>There is a historical worksheet feature in <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> that the User can utilize to analyze
    historical sales and operating expenses that will clarify the most useful numbers to use for the <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em>
    Inputs. This historical information is also used as an evaluation factor in the <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em>.</p>
<p>With the proper information provided, the process will define risks of running short of funds in future periods, which will then
    be feedback information to adjust the business purchase price, terms, debt, equity and or business operations prior to unexpected
    cash shortage occurrences and/or the eventual unsatisfactory profit and equity performance.</p>
