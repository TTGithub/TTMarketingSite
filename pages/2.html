<!-- Features / ThruThink Evaluation -->
<p>Our <em>ThruThink Evaluation<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> services provide an evaluation of a proposed "Deal" or comparative
    benefit to the Owner as presented by the User Inputs. Our <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> services
    provide an evaluation of the proposed "Deal"; which includes a calculated score or rating based on the User inputs.
    The <em>ThruThink Evaluation<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> service evaluates proposed business transactions that 
    involve the purchase, sale, valuation, debt analysis or equity analysis of a business using propriatary calculations from user inputs
    for the business's past performance, existing financial condition and projected future performance. These factors along with
    the specific debt, equity structure and Owner Draw requirements will address the ultimate performance measure of the "Deal",
    "Does it Make Sense".</p>
<p>As <tt>EBITDA</tt> comes as a result of the net effect of income and expenses prior to interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
    <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> incorporates the ability to determine EBITDA by using Gross Sales performance
    and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) percentages, along with summary General Operating Expenses. This is to illustrate sales and expense levels
    that are contemplated in arriving at the projected EBITDA.</p>
<p>Our <em>ThruThink Evaluation<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> service begins where an operational budget ends. The Users 
    Operational Budget is best used as a basis for the <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> inputs, however the User
    can decide on these inputs as they are entered.</p>
<p>There is a historical worksheet feature in <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> that the User can utilize to analyze
    historical sales and operating expenses that will clarify the most useful numbers to use for the <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em>
    Inputs. This historical information is also used as an evaluation factor in the <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em>.</p>
<p>With the proper information provided, the process will define risks of running short of funds in future periods, which will then
    be feedback information to adjust the business purchase price, terms, debt, equity and or business operations prior to unexpected
    cash shortage occurrences and/or the eventual unsatisfactory profit and equity performance.</p>
