                    Our <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> service generates a score for the "Deal" using our propriatiary
    calculations for actual or proposed business transactions from user inputs for the purchase, sale, valuation, debt or equity analysis
    of a business. Our <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> service is not necessarily a score for the quality of
    the Company itself, but a score for the "Deal". In other words, an excellent Company can receive a poor Deal Score because of the level of
    the purchase price or valuation, improper debt or equity structure, capital expenditures, owner draws, etc.

                    Our <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> service is a rating of the "Deal" based on the user's inputs
    for a business's past performance, existing financial condition and projected future performance which will represent the performance 
    of a particular purchase or value in concert with its unique debt and equity structure.
