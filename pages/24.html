                    <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> was born out of the realization that businesses are started and run with passion, but survive and grow with numbers.
                    Some people just don't deal with numbers well and therefore suffer the consequenses of failure or are able to survive to the point of being able to
                    hire good &quot;numbers people&quot;. These are your Clients; the Individuals with an established business, entrepreneurs planning out a new business,
                    retirees planning a new chapter in their lives or simply individuals with a dream. Only a small percentage of these individuals will possess the vision
                    and passion together with the affinity for numbers that are required for long term business success. <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> is designed to bridge
                    this gap.

                <p align="center">
                    Advisors and CPA's are often asked by their clients: Is this a good Deal, Is this too much Debt, How am I doing? Your Clients expect a quick and simple
                    answer to an often complicated question. In order to answer these questions, the Advisor or CPA either must give a very generalized answer or must spend
                    a great deal of time to dig into the Deal. <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> is intended to provide the Advisor or CPA a time saving alternative that will give
                    the &quot;numbers&quot; perspective to their Clients that will help them answer their questions.

                    Data Inputs are inputted and saved as an Individual Project. Each Project can represent different &quot;scenarios&quot; representing different risk levels
                    or opportunities. Whoever inputs the data will become the &quot;Author&quot;. The Author can give access permission to Corporate Accounts, for example
                    the client, banker, investor or other advisor to access the Project.

                   Our <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> service generates a score for the "Deal" using our propriatiary
    calculations for actual or proposed business transactions from user inputs for the purchase, sale, valuation, debt or equity analysis
    of a business. Our <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> service is not necessarily a score for the quality of
    the Company itself, but a score for the "Deal". In other words, an excellent Company can receive a poor Deal Score because of the level of
    the purchase price or valuation, improper debt or equity structure, capital expenditures, owner draws, etc.

                    Our <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> service is a rating of the "Deal" based on the user's inputs

    of a particular purchase or value in concert with its unique debt and equity structure.
