    <p>The inspiration for the name <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> was born out of experiences with long
        distance hiking. A long distance hike sets its goal to go from one place to another over a long distance and is referred to
        as a Thru Hike.</p>
    <p>Chuck Hoyt, who founded <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> has planned and successfully accomplished a
        number of long distance hikes and found that the required planning process needs to be extremely rigorous. On a solo long distance
        hike with large spans between civilization, a lack of proper planning can mean at minimum a much more uncomfortable and difficult
        experience including the likelihood of not achieving the goal and at worst it can be a matter of life and death.

    <p>For a long distance hike, there is an inverse weight-performance relationship &mdash; every detail of clothing, equipment, fuel,
        water and food need to be thought through and managed to the ounce for each day of the hike, all the while taking into consideration
        the Thru Hikers personal health and welfare. The inverse relationship of all of these factors mean that the more weight carried will
        cause less distance covered each day requiring more days to reach the goal which requires more food and fuel adding more weight which
        means less distance covered and so on... a downward spiral, all of which pushes the goal further away. Thorough planning, measuring,
        anticipating, physical conditioning and practice are keys to reversing this downward spiral in order to achieve the goal.</p>
    <p>Chuck owns a management consulting practice that constantly engages business financial and management challenges. Through this experience
        and after preparing and accomplishing a number of Thru Hikes, Chuck realized that preparing and planning for a Thru Hike carries lessons
        for achieving excellence in planning and managing the performance of a business to achieve desired goals over time.</p>
    <p><img class="image-margined" src="img/Chuck1.jpg" align="left" width="200px">
        Thinking through each phase of the business performance, step by step and point by point (ounce by ounce) that progresses thru to a
        future goal, by planning, measuring, anticipating and practicing are keys to achieving the desired business goals with a greater
        probability of success, safety and less risk for those involved. <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> allows
        businesses to play this out by guiding the User to think through each critical business step and practice it with detailed simulation
        modeling.</p>
    <p>This is not so much a matter of predicting the precise outcome much like we cannot predict our actual experiences on a Thru Hike.
        It is a matter of going through a disciplined thought process to consider, review and plan for the factors that are critical to
        accomplishing the desired goal. Disciplined thinking and planning leads to a greater probability of success. Disciplined thinking
        and planning inspired <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> and reflects the same qualities as required in a
        rigorous Thru Hike.</p>
    <p>Life is much like a hike, so go take a great hike! <img src="img/logo1.png"></p>
