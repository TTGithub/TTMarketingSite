<!-- Answers (Why do I need ThruThink) -->
<h5><strong>How much is too much debt?</strong></h5>
<p>Determining how much sales will have to increase in order to afford the debt load and equity return expectations and determining if product
    pricing can be maintained to achieve those sales will make the &quot;risk of the deal&quot; much clearer.</p>
<h5><strong>How much do I pay for the business?</strong></h5>
<p>If past performance will not provide an acceptable return on the Purchase Price or the debt load required for the purchase can not be
    supported by past performance, then the &quot;risk of the deal&quot; is higher and the Purchase Price of the Company may need to be
    lowered.</p>
<h5><strong>What is my Cost of Goods Sold? Are my margins too high?</strong></h5>
<p>Often the lure of increasing sales will lead to product price reductions, discounts, free product give aways, slotting fees which have the
    effect of raising Cost of Goods Sold as a percentage of sales and putting immense pressure on the operating margins of the business.
