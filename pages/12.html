<!-- Combine Multiple Projects -->
<p>With the <em>ThruThink<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> corporate account, individual Projects can be
    combined into one summary Project using the Combine Multiple Project feature. The summary Project can be managed
    just like an individual Project whereby income, expenses, and debt may be added to the Combined Projects summary
    totals and a new Combined Project saved.</p>
<p>With the premium corporate account, this can be used with multiple divisions or factories of one company, whereby
    each division is a separate Project and the Combined Project adds the corporate overhead expense and debt for the
    entire company or similarly with multiple locations of one company or in the case of a franchise, multiple franchise
    locations combined together to represent the entire franchise operation.</p>
