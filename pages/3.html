<!-- Features / ThruThink Deal Score -->
<p>The <em>ThruThink Evaluation<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> evaluates the "Deal" or comparative benefit to the Owner as presented by the
    User Inputs and calculates the <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em>. It is not necessarily a score for the quality of
    the Company itself, but a score for the "Deal". In other words, an excellent Company can receive a poor Deal Score because of the level of
    the purchase price or valuation, improper debt or equity structure, capital expenditures, owner draws, etc.</p>
<p>The <em>ThruThink Deal Score<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> uses proprietary algorithms that evaluates multiple factors involving historical
    information, the transaction itself and the projections which result in an overall grade or score for the "Deal".</p>
