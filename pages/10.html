<!-- Exit Strategy / Exit Strategy Analysis -->
<p>The <em>ThruThink Evaluation<sup style="font-size: x-small">SM</sup></em> process has an Exit Strategy provision that
    provides for the sale of the business and an exit for the Owners or Equity Groups. A business sale value expressed either
    as a whole number sale or a multiple of EBITDA can be entered by the User for a future year within the Users selected time
    horizon.</p>
<p>The process provides for different Equity Groups or owners each at a different % equity and a different % gain on Exit Sale.
    This allows an Equity participant or owner at various levels of participation to have a picture of the return upon exiting
    the Company or "Deal" and determine if the risk and effort of the investment was worth the return. In this context, it also
    allows an owner to see the effect of the expected sales and EBITDA results after debt payments and taxes to determine if
    the business plan will satisfactorily work under the proposed debt load and equity structure. Is there enough potential
    return for the sweat equity of an operating owner and if not, what business factors need to take place to provide a
    satisfactory return with the proposed debt and equity structure? Are the resulting business performance requirements
    dictated by the debt load or equity structure realistic?</p>
